        <h1>How a YouTube Video Became a SaaS Product</h1>
        <p class="date">February 9, 2026</p>

        <p>A month or two ago I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/0teZqotpqT8">a video about
        using an AI agent as a resume assistant</a>. I thought it was a clever idea, and I wanted
        to learn how to build something like it. Around the same time, my client Creative Dezign
        Concepts needed a better way to handle technical support for their product
        <a href="https://dezignworks.com">DezignWorks</a>. So I built them a support
        chatbot &mdash; Flask backend, Anthropic API, PostgreSQL for conversation history,
        a hand-curated knowledge base.</p>

        <p>It worked. The owner was genuinely impressed. And that's when it clicked: every small
        software company has this same problem. They're too small for Zendesk, too busy to answer
        the same questions repeatedly, and too niche for off-the-shelf solutions.</p>

        <p>So I generalized it. The DezignWorks bot became
        <a href="https://recursive.support">Recursive</a>, a platform that gives small businesses
        self-improving AI support agents. The key idea is that the agents don't just answer
        questions &mdash; they analyze their own interactions and propose knowledge base updates,
        surfaced through weekly and monthly reports. The agents get smarter over time without
        requiring constant manual tuning.</p>

        <p>I have a lot more to say about the technical decisions, the deployment infrastructure,
        and what "self-improving" actually means in practice. I'll be writing that up as a series
        over the coming weeks.</p>
