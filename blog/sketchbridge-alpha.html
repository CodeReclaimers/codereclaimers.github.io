        <h1>Announcing SketchBridge Alpha</h1>
        <p class="date">February 2, 2026</p>

        <p>I'm pleased to announce the alpha release of <strong>SketchBridge</strong>, a desktop
        application that makes it easy to transfer 2D sketches between different CAD platforms.</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <p>If you've ever worked with multiple CAD systems, you know the frustration of trying
        to move sketch geometry between them. Each platform uses its own internal format, and
        while standards like STEP and IGES exist for 3D geometry, 2D sketches with their
        constraints are often left behind or degraded during transfer.</p>

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

        <p>SketchBridge provides a simple graphical interface for transferring sketches between
        CAD applications. It currently supports:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>FreeCAD</li>
            <li>Autodesk Fusion 360</li>
            <li>Autodesk Inventor</li>
            <li>SolidWorks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Under the hood, SketchBridge uses <a href="https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/morphe">Morphe</a>,
        a platform-agnostic framework for representing sketch geometry and constraints. This
        intermediate representation allows sketches to be transferred without losing constraint
        information.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Real-time monitoring of connected CAD applications</li>
            <li>Visual preview of sketches before transfer</li>
            <li>Geometric transformations (translation and rotation) during export</li>
            <li>Flexible plane selection for imported sketches</li>
            <li>JSON-based file storage for sharing sketches</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <p>SketchBridge is available on GitHub. This is an alpha release, so expect some rough
        edges, but I welcome feedback and contributions.</p>
